# VagrantOps

Ansible-powered vagrant provisioning.

This project provides the ability to provision your Vagrant virtual machines with Ansible. It offers Ansible roles for common development use cases.

## Benefits

* Provision Vagrant servers using Vagrant without installing Ansible on your host computer
* Re-provision your Vagrant server without re-building the virtual machine
* Host one or multiple projects on each Vagrant virtual machine
* Learn some Ansible (if you want)
